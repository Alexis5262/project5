        <p>The commercial starts like any typical Super Bowl ad—glamorous, cinematic, and well-produced. Just when you think you're watching another high-budget, dramatic ad, the screen suddenly glitches and switches to the Tubi interface. This disruption catches viewers off guard and immediately breaks the fourth wall. The initial confusion—“Did I accidentally change the channel?”—creates a sense of bewilderment that's both surprising and relatable. This unexpected shift is a classic setup for comedy, playing on the universal experience of technological mishaps.</p>
